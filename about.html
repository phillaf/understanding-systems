    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hi, I'm Phil. I studied computer science, and my career has taken me through software development, building systems, debugging problems, and trying to make sense of complex data.</p>

    <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>

    <p>This blog is an experiment in understanding—understanding how the world works, how systems connect, and where power and influence flow. I'm applying the same analytical mindset I learned in computer science to explore economics, corporate networks, financial systems, and the structures that shape our world.</p>

    <p>I'm not an expert in these fields. This is exploratory work—testing ideas, implementing methodologies from research papers, connecting dots, and seeing if the patterns make sense.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <p><strong>Important disclaimer:</strong> I am not an economist, political scientist, or expert in the fields I explore here. This blog should not be viewed as a trustworthy source for professional analysis or advice. Everything here is exploratory, educational (for me), and should be taken with healthy skepticism.</p>
        
        <p><strong>If you're looking for authoritative analysis, please consult actual experts and peer-reviewed research.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>About the Writing</h2>

    <p>The text on this blog has been written by AI under my supervision. I provide the direction, structure, and ideas, but the AI handles the heavy lifting of turning data analysis into readable prose.</p>

    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

    <p>This blog explores systems—economic, political, corporate, and social. Topics include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Economic indicators and patterns in market data</li>
        <li>Corporate ownership networks and media influence</li>
        <li>Power structures and institutional connections</li>
        <li>Financial systems, banking, and investment mechanics</li>
        <li>Technology infrastructure and data ecosystems</li>
        <li>Testing whether published methodologies actually work</li>
        <li>Building transparent, reproducible analysis pipelines</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All analysis uses publicly available data and open methodologies. The goal is to make everything clear, reproducible, and open to scrutiny.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>If you have questions, corrections, or suggestions, feel free to reach out at phil.laf@gmail.com. I'm always happy to learn from people who actually know what they're talking about.</p>
