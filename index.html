            <div class="post-excerpt">
                The economy doesn't move as one unit—it moves in a predictable sequence. We test the Four Economy Framework against 45 years of data: does tracking Leading → Cyclical → Aggregate → Lagging economies actually predict recessions better than standard indicators? The results show why construction and manufacturing are the pulse of the business cycle, why the 2022-2025 yield curve inversion failed to predict recession, and whether you can trade profitably on the sequence.

            <div class="post-date">December 2025</div>
            <div class="post-excerpt">
                Credit spreads—the premium investors demand for corporate debt over safe government bonds—are widely cited as recession indicators. When spreads widen, it supposedly signals rising default risk and coming economic trouble. But does this actually work? We test 45 years of credit spread data against every US recession since 1980, measuring lead times, threshold levels, false positives, and predictive accuracy. The results show spreads work differently than the yield curve—and sometimes better.

            <div class="post-excerpt">
                The yield curve inverted before 7 of the last 8 US recessions. But what is the yield curve, why does it invert, and how reliable is this signal? We analyze 50+ years of bond market data to understand how bonds work, what the yield curve reveals about economic expectations, and whether the inversion signal actually holds up empirically. The results show a remarkably consistent pattern—with important caveats.

                Interest rate differentials, purchasing power parity, trade balances—everyone has theories about what drives currency movements. But what does the data actually show? We test seven major theories against real exchange rate data for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD using regression analysis and visualizations. The results reveal which factors actually matter and which are just noise.

                From gold-backed currencies to central bank digital currencies, the global financial system has been rebuilt multiple times in the past century. We trace the journey: Bretton Woods (1944), the Nixon Shock (1971), the Washington Consensus (1989), the 2008 crisis, and the emerging multipolar order. Understanding this history explains why the system works the way it does today—and where it's headed.
