# Toy Model: Recession Prediction from Financial Stress Signals
#
# This is a minimal model to test the framework.
# It uses relationships validated in our blog articles:
# - Credit spreads predict recessions (~6 months lead)
# - Fed rate affects credit conditions
#
# Signals flow: fed_rate → credit_spread → recession_probability
#
# Time unit: MONTHS
