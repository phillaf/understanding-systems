  "title": "Bond Markets and the Yield Curve: Why Inverted Curves Predict Recessions",
  "date": "2025-12-30",
  "excerpt": "The yield curve inverted before 7 of the last 8 US recessions. But what is the yield curve, why does it invert, and how reliable is this signal? We analyze 50+ years of bond market data to understand how bonds work, what the yield curve reveals about economic expectations, and whether the inversion signal actually holds up empirically. The results show a remarkably consistent pattern—with important caveats."
