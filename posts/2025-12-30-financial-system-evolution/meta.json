  "excerpt": "From gold-backed currencies to central bank digital currencies, the global financial system has been rebuilt multiple times in the past century. We trace the journey: Bretton Woods (1944), the Nixon Shock (1971), the Washington Consensus (1989), the 2008 crisis, and the emerging multipolar order.
