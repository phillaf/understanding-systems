## Data Sources

Unlike other posts, this article is primarily research-based rather than data-analysis-based. Sources include:
- Official organizational websites
- Council on Foreign Relations backgrounders
- Academic papers and books
- Wikipedia for general reference
- News archives for major decisions

## Future Enhancements

Potential data-driven additions:
- IMF lending patterns over time
- World Bank project database analysis
- WTO dispute resolution statistics
- G20 policy commitments vs. actual implementation
- Network analysis of leadership overlaps between organizations
- Voting power visualization in weighted voting systems

## Research Questions

- How often do these organizations coordinate vs. conflict?
- Can we measure the actual impact of their decisions?
- What's the relationship between organizational power and democratic accountability?
- How have power dynamics shifted over time (esp. with China's rise)?
