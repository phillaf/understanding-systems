## Recommended Additions to Article:

### Tier 1 (Must Add):
1. **WHO** - COVID proved its importance
2. **BRICS** - Represents power shift away from West
3. **BIS** - Hidden but critical financial infrastructure

### Tier 2 (Should Add):
4. **OECD** - Developed world policy coordination
5. **ASEAN** - Major regional bloc in fastest-growing region

### Tier 3 (Consider):
6. **ILO** - Labor rights globally
7. **African Union** - Represents 1.3 billion people
8. **Basel Committee** - Banking rules affect everyone

## Analysis by Influence Type:

### **Health**: WHO (missing!)
### **Labor**: ILO (missing!)
### **Banking**: BIS, Basel Committee (missing!)
### **Trade**: WTO (covered), USMCA, RCEP (missing regional ones)
### **Rising Powers**: BRICS (missing!), SCO
### **Regional**: EU (covered), ASEAN (missing!), AU (missing!), OAS

## Decision:
**Minimum additions needed:**
- WHO - too important to omit
- BRICS - represents major geopolitical shift
- BIS - financial infrastructure

**Optional additions:**
- OECD - if covering "developed world" specifically
- ASEAN - if covering regional blocs comprehensively
