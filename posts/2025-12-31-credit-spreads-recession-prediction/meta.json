  "title": "Do Credit Spreads Predict Recessions? Testing the Market Stress Signal",
  "date": "2025-12-31",
  "excerpt": "Credit spreads—the premium investors demand for corporate debt over safe government bonds—are widely cited as recession indicators. When spreads widen, it supposedly signals rising default risk and coming economic trouble. But does this actually work? We test 45 years of credit spread data against every US recession since 1980, measuring lead times, threshold levels, false positives, and predictive accuracy. The results show spreads work differently than the yield curve—and sometimes better."
