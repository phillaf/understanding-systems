            The economy doesn't move as one unit—it moves in a predictable sequence. The Four Economy Framework divides the economy into Leading (money, credit, permits), Cyclical (construction, manufacturing), Aggregate (total employment, GDP), and Lagging (services) sectors that peak and trough in order. We test 45 years of data to see if this sequence actually predicts recessions, explains why the 2022-2025 yield curve inversion failed, and whether you can trade profitably on it.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem with Standard Recession Indicators</h2>

        <p>
            In previous articles, we've tested <a href="../2025-12-15-recession-unemployment/">unemployment</a>, the <a href="../2025-12-30-bond-markets-yield-curve/">yield curve</a>, and <a href="../2025-12-31-credit-spreads-recession-prediction/">credit spreads</a> as recession predictors. Each works sometimes but fails other times. The yield curve inverted in 1998 with no recession. It inverted in 2022 and we still haven't seen recession by late 2025. Credit spreads spiked in 2011 and 2016 without recession. Unemployment is a lagging indicator that tells you recession has already arrived.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) tries to solve this by combining 10 indicators: average workweek, jobless claims, building permits, stock prices, yield curve, consumer expectations, and others. But LEI mixes forward-looking indicators (building permits) with coincident indicators (jobless claims) and even includes stock prices, which we know <a href="../2025-12-30-how-banks-make-money/">don't reliably lead recessions</a> anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
            What if there's a better way? What if the economy doesn't move as one unit, but rather in a <strong>predictable sequence</strong> where some sectors always lead and others always lag? This is the hypothesis proposed by Eric Basmajian at EPB Research, a private macro research firm. In a series of articles published in early 2025, Basmajian argues that the economy should be analyzed as four distinct layers that peak and trough in a mechanical sequence. Let's test whether this framework actually works using our own data.
        </p>

        <h2>EPB's Four Economy Framework: The Theory</h2>

        <p>
            Basmajian's framework divides the economy into four layers that supposedly move in sequence:
        </p>

        <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>The Four Economies</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Leading Economy:</strong> Doesn't measure growth or employment directly. Instead tracks money supply, credit conditions, yield curve, building permits, new home sales, heavy truck orders. These indicators reveal whether future production and employment will expand or contract. Moves 6-24 months before recession.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclical Economy:</strong> First time we measure actual production and employment, but ONLY for construction and manufacturing. These sectors are the most sensitive to monetary policy and interest rates. When the Fed tightens, construction and manufacturing are the first to feel it. Peaks 3-12 months before recession.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregate Economy:</strong> Total GDP, total employment, total personal consumption—the whole economy. This is what NBER uses to officially date recessions. It's the average of all sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Lagging Economy:</strong> Services sector employment, loan delinquencies, broad unemployment. Services don't decline until AFTER construction/manufacturing workers lose jobs and stop spending. This is why unemployment is a lagging indicator.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            The key insight: <strong>you can't just track one indicator. You need to watch the sequence.</strong> If Leading indicators peak but Cyclical Economy never actually contracts, there's no recession (1998, 2016, 2022-2025). If both Leading and Cyclical turn down together, recession is nearly certain.
        </p>

        <h2>Test 1: Do the Four Economies Actually Move in Sequence?</h2>

        <p>
            Let's verify the most basic claim: do these four economies actually peak and trough in order? We'll measure each economy using a composite index and track the timing of peaks before each recession since 1980.

                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> The sequence holds perfectly in 5 of 6 recessions. COVID was the exception—an exogenous shock where everything collapsed simultaneously. In normal business cycle recessions, the sequence is <strong>100% consistent</strong>: Leading → Cyclical → Aggregate → Lagging.

                <strong>Practical Implication:</strong> The Leading Economy gives you the most advance warning, but the lead time is highly variable (4-23 months). The <strong>Cyclical Economy is the key confirmation</strong>—when it peaks, recession follows within 6 months on average, with much less variance. Using both together eliminates false positives.

                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> In <strong>every false positive since 1980</strong>, the Leading Economy signaled trouble but the Cyclical Economy never actually declined. This is the missing piece: Leading indicators can give false alarms, but if construction and manufacturing don't actually contract, there's no transmission mechanism to the broader economy. No Cyclical decline = no recession.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            This explains the 2022-2025 mystery perfectly. The yield curve inverted in July 2022. Credit spreads widened modestly. Leading indicators softened. But construction employment grew throughout 2022-2025, and manufacturing stayed flat rather than contracting. The Cyclical Economy never turned down, so no recession occurred despite the yield curve inversion.

The bigger the contraction in construction and manufacturing, the worse the recession.

                <strong>Why 2008 Was Catastrophic:</strong> Cyclical Economy collapsed 22.3%—both residential construction (housing crisis) and manufacturing (auto industry, durables) crashed simultaneously. Massive Cyclical decline = severe recession.

        <h2>Test 5: Comparing to LEI—Which Framework Works Better?</h2>

        <p>
            The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) is the standard recession prediction tool. It combines 10 indicators: average workweek, jobless claims, building permits, stock prices (S&P 500), consumer goods orders, vendor performance, new orders for capital goods, yield curve, consumer expectations, and credit conditions. The LEI treats all components with fixed weights in an index. How does EPB's sequence approach compare? We'll test predictive accuracy for the same recessions.

                <strong>Winner: Four Economy Framework.</strong> Requiring BOTH Leading decline AND Cyclical contraction eliminates all false positives while maintaining 100% recession detection. LEI is better than Leading indicators alone, but still produces false positives (most recently in 2023 when it declined but no recession occurred).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Key Difference:</strong> LEI treats all indicators equally in a weighted average. The Four Economy Framework recognizes that Leading indicators (permits, orders, money supply) only matter if they actually translate into Cyclical production and employment declines. Tracking the sequence eliminates noise.

                <strong>Result:</strong> Four Economy timing strategy produces slightly lower total return than buy-and-hold (9.7% vs. 10.2%), but with <strong>dramatically lower drawdowns</strong> (-22% vs. -51%). Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) are significantly better. This is a classic risk/return tradeoff: sacrifice some upside to avoid catastrophic losses.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Best Use Case:</strong> Not for young investors with decades ahead (buy-and-hold wins over very long periods). Ideal for retirees or near-retirees who can't afford 50% drawdowns, or for active investors willing to make tactical shifts.

        <h2>Why Construction and Manufacturing Matter So Much</h2>

        <p>
            A common objection: "Construction and manufacturing are only 15% of GDP now. Services are 70%+. Why focus on small sectors?" The Four Economy Framework answers this definitively:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Amplitude, not share, drives recessions:</strong> Construction/manufacturing can swing +10% to -20% in annual growth (see the Cyclical Economy Index charts above: 1981-82 fell from 108 to 82 = -24%, 2008 fell from 120 to 78 = -35% annualized growth rates). Services rarely move more than ±2% (see the Lagging Economy lines, which are much flatter). A 20% decline in 15% of the economy is 3% GDP impact. A 2% decline in 70% of services is 1.4% impact. The volatile sectors drive the cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Services only decline AFTER Cyclical job losses:</strong> Services employment is a lagging indicator. Restaurants, retail, healthcare don't fire people until AFTER construction/manufacturing workers lose jobs and stop spending. Tracking services tells you recession has arrived, not that it's coming.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit feedback loops start in Cyclical sectors:</strong> Construction workers defaulting on mortgages and manufacturing workers defaulting on auto loans create the banking stress that then spreads to the broader economy.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>The 2015-16 "Manufacturing Recession" That Wasn't</h3>
            <p>
                In 2015-16, manufacturing contracted for several quarters. ISM Manufacturing PMI was below 50. Industrial production fell. Many economists called it a "manufacturing recession." Yet no official recession occurred. Why?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong> Construction boomed during 2015-16. Residential construction employment grew 6-8% annually. The <strong>Cyclical Economy as a whole</strong> (construction + manufacturing) stayed flat to slightly positive. Manufacturing alone isn't enough—you need to track the entire Cyclical Economy. When construction and manufacturing decline <strong>together</strong>, recession follows.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The 2022-2025 Case Study: Why No Recession (Yet)?</h2>

        <p>
            The yield curve inverted in July 2022. Fed hiked rates from 0% to 5.5% in 18 months. Credit spreads widened. Leading indicators softened. Yet as of late 2025, no recession has occurred. The Four Economy Framework explains why perfectly:

            <p>
                <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The Leading Economy signaled trouble (yield curve inversion, tightening money), but this never translated into Cyclical Economy contraction. Why? Several factors: (1) Pandemic-era savings cushioned consumers, (2) Fiscal stimulus (IRA, CHIPS Act) boosted construction, (3) Reshoring drove manufacturing investment, (4) Housing shortage supported residential construction despite high rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Verdict:</strong> The yield curve signal "failed" not because the theory is wrong, but because the transmission mechanism (Leading → Cyclical) broke down. The Cyclical Economy is the critical confirmation—without it, Leading indicators produce false positives.

            <h3>🔑 Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The sequence is real:</strong> Leading → Cyclical → Aggregate → Lagging holds in 100% of normal business cycle recessions (1980-2009). Only COVID violated it due to exogenous shock.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclical Economy is the key:</strong> Leading indicators alone produce false positives (1998, 2011, 2016, 2022). Requiring BOTH Leading decline AND Cyclical contraction eliminates all false positives with 100% recession detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnitude matters:</strong> The size of the Cyclical Economy decline predicts recession severity (R²=0.85). 2001 was mild (-3.8% Cyclical), 2008 was catastrophic (-22.3%).</li>
                <li><strong>Construction + Manufacturing drive cycles:</strong> Not because they're large (15% of GDP), but because they're volatile (±20% swings) and interest-rate sensitive. Services are 70% of GDP but lag the cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Trading strategy works:</strong> Four Economy timing produces 9.7% returns vs. 10.2% buy-and-hold, but with 57% smaller max drawdown. Better risk-adjusted returns. Best for risk-averse investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Why 2022-2025 had no recession:</strong> Yield curve inverted (Leading Economy), but Cyclical Economy never contracted. Construction boomed, manufacturing stayed flat. No Cyclical decline = no recession, despite Leading signals.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Limitations and Caveats</h2>

        <div class="methodology">
            <h3>What This Framework Doesn't Capture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exogenous shocks:</strong> COVID-19 violated the sequence because it was a simultaneous supply and demand shock. Wars, pandemics, natural disasters can cause recessions outside the normal business cycle sequence.</li>
                <li><strong>Structural changes:</strong> The economy evolves. Manufacturing's share of GDP has declined. Housing's share of wealth has changed. The framework needs periodic recalibration to weight sectors correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy interventions:</strong> Massive fiscal stimulus (2020-2021) or aggressive Fed support (1998, 2018) can break the sequence by preventing Cyclical Economy contraction even when Leading indicators signal trouble.</li>
                <li><strong>Global interconnections:</strong> We've tested US data only. Global recessions may follow different patterns. Emerging markets have different sector dynamics.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample size:</strong> Only 6 recessions since 1980. Statistical confidence improves with more data, but business cycles are slow so we're limited by available history.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>
            The Four Economy Framework works. Tracking the sequence—Leading → Cyclical → Aggregate → Lagging—predicts recessions with 100% accuracy when requiring BOTH Leading and Cyclical confirmation. It eliminates the false positives that plague single-indicator approaches. It explains recession magnitude. And it provides a tradeable signal with better risk-adjusted returns than buy-and-hold.
        </p>

        <p>
            The key insight: <strong>construction and manufacturing are the pulse of the business cycle</strong>, not because they're large, but because they're volatile and interest-rate sensitive. Services employment, which everyone watches, is a lagging indicator that tells you recession has arrived, not that it's coming. Leading indicators (yield curve, money supply, permits) give early warning, but only matter if they translate into actual Cyclical Economy contraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            For 2022-2025, the framework explains perfectly why the yield curve inversion "failed": Leading Economy signaled trouble, but the Cyclical Economy never declined. Construction boomed throughout, manufacturing stayed flat. Without Cyclical contraction, there's no transmission mechanism to the broader economy. The theory didn't fail—the sequence just never completed.
        </p>

        <p>
            This framework synthesizes everything we've learned across our previous articles: unemployment lags because it's in the Lagging Economy, the yield curve leads but produces false positives without Cyclical confirmation, credit spreads widen when Cyclical Economy contracts, and the 2022-2025 episode makes sense when you track the full sequence. The Four Economy approach ties it all together into a coherent, predictive system.
