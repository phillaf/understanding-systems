  "excerpt": "The economy doesn't move as one unit—it moves in a predictable sequence. We test the Four Economy Framework against 45 years of data: does tracking Leading → Cyclical → Aggregate → Lagging economies actually predict recessions better than standard indicators? The results show why construction and manufacturing are the pulse of the business cycle, why the 2022-2025 yield curve inversion failed to predict recession, and whether you can trade profitably on the sequence."
