  "description": "Mortgage rates track 10-year Treasury yields closely, but with a spread that fluctuates wildly. During 2008, the spread hit 3%. During QE, it compressed to 1.5%. Now it's back to 2%+. We analyze 50+ years of data to show what actually controls mortgage rates: Treasury yields, Fed policy, inflation expectations, and the MBS market.",
